# HealthCare+ E-Channelling System

## Overview

HealthCare+ is a comprehensive web-based e-channelling (appointment booking) system designed for healthcare providers. It provides a modern, responsive platform for patients to book appointments with doctors, while offering role-based dashboards for doctors, patients, and administrators. The system operates in a demo mode with mock data storage to showcase functionality without requiring a live database.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: HTML5, CSS3 (with CSS variables for theming), Vanilla JavaScript
- **Design Pattern**: Component-based architecture with class-based JavaScript modules
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible grid layouts
- **Theme System**: Dynamic theme switching with automatic time-based themes and manual controls
- **Multi-step Forms**: Complex booking flow with step-by-step navigation and validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Server Technology**: PHP 8.2 with built-in development server
- **Data Storage**: Mock data storage system (simulating database functionality)
- **API Architecture**: RESTful API endpoints with role-based access control
- **Session Management**: Custom session handling with secure cookie implementation
- **Authentication**: Static demo authentication with role-based permissions

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Problem**: Secure user authentication across multiple user roles
- **Solution**: Mock authentication system with session-based security
- **Roles Supported**: Patient, Doctor, Admin, Staff
- **Features**: Login/logout, registration, session validation, role-based access

### Booking System
- **Problem**: Complex multi-step appointment booking process
- **Solution**: JavaScript-driven wizard interface with step validation
- **Components**: Doctor selection, date/time picker, patient details, payment processing
- **Features**: Real-time availability checking, booking confirmation, payment integration

### Dashboard System
- **Problem**: Different interfaces needed for different user types
- **Solution**: Role-specific dashboards with shared navigation framework
- **Patient Dashboard**: Appointment management, doctor search, profile management
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Schedule management, patient records, availability settings
- **Admin Dashboard**: System overview, user management, reporting

### Theme Management
- **Problem**: User preference for light/dark themes and automatic switching
- **Solution**: CSS variable-based theme system with JavaScript controller
- **Features**: Manual theme switching, automatic time-based themes, system preference detection
- **Themes**: Light, Dark, Auto (time-based switching)

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. PHP auth handler validates against mock user data
3. Session created and stored in mock storage
4. Session ID set as HTTP-only cookie
5. Subsequent requests validate session for protected routes

### Booking Flow
1. Patient selects doctor from public listings
2. JavaScript loads available time slots via API
3. Patient fills booking form across multiple steps
4. Form validation at each step before progression
5. Final booking stored in mock data storage
6. Confirmation sent to user and doctor

### Dashboard Data Flow
1. Authentication check on page load
2. Role-based API calls to fetch relevant data
3. JavaScript renders data into dashboard components
4. Real-time updates through periodic API calls
5. User actions trigger API updates and UI refresh

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Libraries
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library for UI elements
- **CDN Delivered**: Reduces bundle size and improves loading

### Backend Dependencies
- **PHP Built-in Server**: Development server for local testing
- **Session Management**: Custom implementation without external dependencies
- **No Database**: Mock storage system eliminates database requirements

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Server**: PHP built-in development server on port 5000
- **Hot Reload**: Manual refresh required for changes
- **Configuration**: Replit-based development with multi-language support

### Production Considerations
- **Database Migration**: Designed to easily integrate with PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **Session Storage**: Can be upgraded to Redis or database-backed sessions
- **File Storage**: Currently local, can be moved to cloud storage
- **Security**: HTTPS termination, secure headers, input validation ready

### Scalability Approach
- **API-First Design**: Frontend and backend are loosely coupled
- **Role-Based Architecture**: Easy to add new user types and permissions
- **Modular Components**: Individual features can be upgraded independently
